# Problem
*Modern technologies are becoming a greater part of our lives. We are suggesting a few fragments of the basic logic behind a school system  that should replace any non-digital data carriers used in our education system. Automatisation will make it much faster and much easier to distribute data (such as grades, absences, information about a student's discipline, meeting appointments) between teachers, students and their parents. It will also help people have access to all that information at any time and any place.*
